## Starting Notes
*	Congrats, almost-doctor, you’ve finished writing your dissertation! Now you need to format it so it meets submission standards.
*	Here’s a guide for formatting your dissertation in Microsoft Word. You will want to do this in Word, even though you might have written it in Google Docs. Page numbering in Google Docs is not fun.
*	If you wrote your chapters in separate Google Docs, merge them all together in a Google Doc before exporting it as a Word file.
*	Insert all your figures in the Word doc and set “Wrap text” to “In Line With Text”. Make sure figures are in a small file format like PNG (if someone tells you to insert them as PDFs or some high resolution format, just don’t). Do not use the text box feature to insert figure legends, insert them as part of the text (can be single spaced)
*	You can insert tables at the Google Doc phase or Word doc phase; the formatting doesn’t seem to get messed up with the tables

## Sections
*	The title page and the pre main text section each need to be defined as separate sections in order to format the numbering correctly
*	Make separate section by selecting “Layout”, “Breaks”, “Next Page”

## Page numbers
*	Double click page header region starting on the page after the title page: In “Header & Footer” select “Page Number”, “Format Page Numbers…” and select the lowercase Roman numerals to number the pre main text section
*	Double click page header region starting on the title page: Select “Different First Page” to remove number from title page
*	Double click page header region starting on the first page of main text: In “Header & Footer” select “Page Number”, “Format Page Numbers…” and change the settings to start page number at 1

## Headers
*	To make table of contents, list of figures, and list of tables, all headings you want to appear need to be defined with headings
*	Here’s an easy way to label headers:
    *	Heading 1 = Major section headings (e.g. dissertation abstract, acknowledgments, table of contents, chapter titles, etc.)
    *	Heading 2 = Chapter headings (e.g. chapter abstract, chapter intro, chapter, results, etc.)
    *	Heading 3 = Chapter subheaders (i.e. the headers you have within the results sections of chapters)
    *	Heading 4 = Figure titles
    *	Heading 5 = Table titles
*	To define a heading, highlight a header, right click “Heading X”, “Update Heading X to Match Selection”. 
    *	You only have to do this once per heading level to define the formatting for the heading
    *	Once you define the formatting, you can just highlight other headings and click on the heading level you want to assign it
*	For your figures and tables, you’ll have to stray a little from regular publishing conventions and have the “Fig. X. Figure title” on a separate line from the legend.

## Table of Contents
*	This should ideally be the very last thing you do
*	Once you have all your headings defined, you should be able to insert a table of contents
*	To insert table of contents, select “References”, “Table of Contents”, “Custom Table of Contents”
    *	The default settings for “From template” here are fine, but you can select “Modify…” to change formatting settings, such as if you want certain heading levels to be bolded in the Table of Contents
    *	Make sure the “Tab leader” is ……….
    *	Make sure the “Show levels” is at 3 if you are following the above heading definitions (just make sure whatever heading levels your figures and tables are defined at are not included in the table of contents)
*	If you make changes to headers or anything in the document, you can update the table of contents by right clicking the table, and selecting “Update Field”

## Lists of Figures and Tables
*	To insert a list of figures or tables, select “References”, “Table of Contents”, “Custom Table of Contents”
    *	Set “Show levels” to 4 for figures or 5 for tables if you are following the above heading definitions (or to whatever level you have the figures or tables defined at)
    *	Select “Options…” then remove numbers next to the headings you do not what in the list and put 1 next to the heading level you do want in the list
*	If after you select “Ok” it highlights the table of contents and asks if you want to replace this table of contents, select “No”
*	If your list of figures includes the images of the figures themselves, it is because it was included in the heading when you assigned a level to the heading; to fix this, highlight just the image and assign it to “Normal text” level
